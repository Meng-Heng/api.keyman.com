# Data files for tests

Because this data takes a while to build, and is static, we normally load the database with it before any tests start. The script /tests/prepare.php will fill the databases indicated in your environment with the test data.

These data files were downloaded at approximately 2020-05-25 3:40pm AEST.
Note: langtags.json - version 1.1.1 downloaded from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/silnrsi/langtags/master/pub/langtags.json (1.1.1 is still in staging)
